Watch for any New-Bloods

Travenling the wastelands, I'm sure you have ran into many new wanderers. Those that seem lost, having trouble, or a combination of the two. 
That's where you come in. Find them. Secure them, that is, if they're willing. Bring them to the area west of nash.

Protect any New-Bloods

In the case of these new wanderers actively seeking help, and you're confident the particular individual is new, go to them. Request the location.
Offer any assistance they may require and show them how to better defend themselves.

Alternatively, act as a protective bodyguard of them until they no longer need you.

Guide any New-Bloods to Glory

Amidst your adventures with any founds wanderers, teach them about various assets available to them. Any and all of these could be a various combination
of essentials. Listed below will be some examples:

- Self Treatment: Teach them the effectiveness of various bandages, sutures, and/or medicine they may come across.

- Weapon Essentials: Show about the quality of guns. You do not have to be extremely thorough. At the bare minium teach them about modifications and the
various effects of weapon handling.

- Artifacts, Tech, and etc: This can be taught as you see fit. At minimum tell them what specific things do if they ask.
