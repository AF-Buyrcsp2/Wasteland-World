This file is sorted by the list in coyote self_lewdness that follows on the next line.
For those that use Dreammaker for some god awful reason you can search this file using the alphanumeric following the name of the body location.
I also ask that if you add to this list, include what you added in this guide at the top of the page, and cycle up the version number as you move down the list.
While github absolutely will track this PR, it helps whoever comes behind you to know who may have done what, or how many 'versions' their code may or may not be behind without needing to hunt that info down on git.a

Happy MERPING!  ~TK<3

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Prototyping																							//
//  We are going to use three 'concepts' of how to approach a Mechanical ERP Verb in this section here.	//
//  They are as follows.																				//
// ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//		Giving Verbs		//				Recieving Verbs				//			Mutual Verbs		//
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//	Giving Verbs are designed for increasing the partners arousal, but not your own.					//
//	Recieving Verbs are for increaing your own arousal, but not your partners.							//
//	Mutual Verbs increase both partners arousal at the same time.										//
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//Concept Repository
//This section exists to store some examples of things that we can use to make other verbs with. These have been hand picked out of splurts actual verbs to help the concept 
//of design for more advanced users. If you are just attempting to make your first emote then perhaps you should avoid using these, as they do complicate the design process.

//(target.a_intent == INTENT_HELP/DISARM/GRAB/HARM)  This is used to check what the intent of the TARGET is. This is for things such as restraint roleplay, but perhaps has other uses.
// (target.restrained()  Checks if the target is restrained.
// (user.restrained()  Checks if the user is restrained.
// [pick("word-a", "word-b)]  We can use this to create more dynamic language in messages
